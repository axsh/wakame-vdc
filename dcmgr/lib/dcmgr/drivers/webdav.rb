    # Note on CommandAPI (shell onliner) support.

    # For PUT operation, some of DAV servers lacks to support
    #   Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    # Oneliner command line requires the chunked transfer support
    # because it can not determine the complete byte length prior to send body.
    #
    # Following web servers support chunked transfer for PUT:
    #    Apache >2.2
    #    Nginx >1.3.9
