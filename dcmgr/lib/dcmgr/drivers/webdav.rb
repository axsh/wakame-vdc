    # Note on CommandAPI (shell onliner) support.

    # For PUT operation, most of DAV servers check the Content-Length
    # header and expect to be sent from the client. The content will
    # be rejected if the header has wrong value.
    # It is difficult to send the proper size of the image file from
    # the shell oneliner without creating temporary file. Because the
    # data is transformed to different format, i.e. gzip,  then the
    # generated data size is vary while goes through the shell pipeline.
    # Therefore, this driver no longer supports shell onliner API.
