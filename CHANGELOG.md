# Change Log

All notable changes to Wakame-vdc will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [15.4] - 2015-07-31

`Changed` Adopted Semantic Versioning.

Before this version, Wakame-vdc was constantly releasing every time we merged code while sometimes assigning a version number based on the current date. Since version numbers based on date don't conform to semantic versioning, we have decided to drop that format. The new format will be: `Major version`.`Minor version`.`Hotfix`

From now on we will release stable versions every few months while keeping track of the changes in this file.

`Added` Support for Windows instances.

`Added` An RPM package to install mussel.

`Added` Bash completion for the mussel commands.

`Added` A .deb package to install the wakame-init script on machine images running Ubuntu.

`Changed` Deleting a load balancer now only outputs its UUID instead of a full hash.

`Fixed` Several small bugfixes in vdc-manage.

`Fixed` A couple of missing localization lines in the GUI.

`Fixed` An issue where HVA would crash if dc_network wasn't set in the database.

`Fixed` An issue where it was impossible to filter WebAPI output for halted instances or load balancers.

`Fixed` An issue where load balancers would some times fail because they were trying to start before the network is up.

`Fixed` A crash that would occur in the GUI when logging in with a user that's not associated to any accounts.

`Fixed` An issue where the backup cleaner script wouldn't be able to connect to the MySQL database.
