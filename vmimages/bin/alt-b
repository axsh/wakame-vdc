# NOTE: Sometimes all the keys above are typed OK and the ks.cfg file
# is read in OK, but the installation does not start until the user
# clicks on the "Begin" button.  One possible cause could be the VNC
# windows being open and some UI events being sent to the graphical
# installer, which senses the human there and politely asks for
# confirmation.

# Update: Nope. Did not work even with no vncviewer connected.  Looks like
# alt-B will select that button.  Seems to take at least 20 seconds to get
# to that screen so....
